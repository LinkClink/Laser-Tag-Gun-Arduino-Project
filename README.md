# Laser-Tag-Gun-Arduino-Project

# Project Title:
* Laser Tag gun

# Description:
* When I started to do this project, I wanted to make a weapon similar to the AK-47 machine, and as a result, something very similar was made: Arduino has its own language very similar to known languages such as (`C++/C`), based on this, the driver it manages Arduino and other drivers.
* What is [Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#IDE)

# Functions:
* reload gun
* shooting (send IR signal)
* receive IR signal
* change team
* start a new game

# Technologies used:
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino Libraries
- C++

# How to start?
1. You need to download this project.
2. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. Open one with weapons version file `.ino`, with a toggle or not.
- Enjoy!

# Diagram description:
In the diagram I use the following buttons:
- for shooting
- for changing the type of shooting (auto, semi-auto)
- to reload the gun
Uses the loudspeaker to give different sounds, we take the records themselves from the SD card and read them.
We also have an IR transmitter and sensor for sending shooting signals and receiving signals.
To power the Arduino, we use Lipo batteries and a converter, and we can charge it via a micro-USB port.

# Project cost:
* The project itself sells for around $ 23 with a battery and $ 14 without.
